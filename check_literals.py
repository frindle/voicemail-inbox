"""Assert every `## Must contain` literal from TASK.md is in the right file.

ADDITIONAL to the behavioural cases, never a replacement: a literal check is a
proxy and passes on a file that contains the right text and does the wrong
thing. But a verify asserting NO spec literal cannot tell a correct
implementation from an inverted one -- a whole literal cannot match its own
negation. So: both.

LITERALS is written here VERBATIM by `ollama-dispatch-scaffold --freeze-literals`
rather than read from TASK.md at run time. A dynamic read is better engineering
and worse evidence: the literal never appears in the verify text, so a grader
scanning the verify cannot see that it is asserted, and verify-quality.py
correctly reported "the verify asserts none of them". The drift guard below is
what makes a second copy safe -- two records of one fact drift, always.

PER-FILE literals: a `## Must contain` bullet may PIN a literal to a specific
file, e.g.  `- in app/api/x/route.ts: ` + a backtick-quoted token. That literal
is then required in THAT file, not the default TARGET. A bare bullet (just a
backtick-quoted token) keeps checking TARGET. This lets a multi-file fix (a
helper file + the route wiring that calls it) pin each side to the file it
belongs in, instead of asserting everything against one file. Canonical frozen
form is a list of [file_or_null, literal] pairs; a legacy flat list of bare
strings is still accepted (each treated as a TARGET literal).
